Problem Statement
Using Java, find all of the English words in a given String. For example, if you are given the word WORKING, 
you can easily find WORK and KING, but ROW, RING and KNOW are also in there. You have access to a utility class called Dictionary, 
which has one method, isEnglishWord(String word). 
Dictionary.isEnglishWord(String word) connects to a (mocked) online dictionary and returns Boolean true if the String passed to it is an English word, 
return false otherwise.

Assumptions
Words are matched from Mock Dictionary with limited words to test the logic only.


Steps:
Import this project as maven project
